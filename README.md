## What is SCM?
Source Code Management (SCM) is the application of keeping track of and managing changes made to software code. It allows development teams to collaborate productively by keeping a history of the modifications made to code, resolving issues, and ensuring that team members are working on the latest version of the project. SCM is essentially a way to organize and keep track of code development. 

## How does GitHub Help?
GitHub has many tools, features, and environments that help SCM making it easier and more efficient to collaborate on software development. The features that GitHub provides are: 
* Version Control:
**Can keep track of changes and revert back to old versions.
* Collaboration:
**Allows multiple developers to work on the same coding project.
* Branching and Merging:
**Allows parallel development and the integration of coding changes.
* Code Review:
**Makes it easier to give feedback and ensure quality control
